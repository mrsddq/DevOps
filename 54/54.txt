IQ: What is Ansible Fact?
Complete control of the server. It tells you have each and every detail of server node and even can delete the server. 
IQ: Idempotent behaviour of Ansible ?
If command is ran for first time. But if the command is repeated it won't change.
ansible server-2 -m file -a "dest=/home/ansadmin/test-file state=directory" //directory is present at the dest!
ansible server-2 -m file -a "dest=/home/ansadmin/test-file state=absent" //directory is removed from the dest!
ansible server-2 -m file -a "dest=/home/ansadmin/test-file/sample.txt state=touch" //file is present at the dest!
ansible server-2 -m shell -a "df -h"//how much space is available
sudo nano python-code.py //creates a file 
pwd //shows current power working directory
ansible server-2 -m copy -a "src=/etc/ansible/python-code.py dest=/home/ansadmin"
ansible server-2 -m yum -a "name=httpd state=present"//this gives error so you need to be root user
ansible server-2 -m yum -a "name=httpd state=present" -v// this -v will give background information
ansible server-2 -m yum -a "name=httpd state=present" -vvv// this -vvv will give detailed background information
ansible server-2 -m yum -a "name=httpd state=present" -b// this yum command to install a software and this -b is become a root user command
ansible server-2 -m service -a "name=httpd state=started" -b //this "service" command to start the service
ansible server-2 -m service -a "name=httpd state=restarted" -b// this commad is used to restart a server via restarted through service
ansible server-2 -m command -a "service httpd status" -b//this command ran on server-2 and get the output

For some installation, we need to provide SSH password.
