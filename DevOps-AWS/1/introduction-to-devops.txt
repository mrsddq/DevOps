introduction to DevOps
======================

software development life cycle (SDLC):
  ideation: brainstrom ideas that solve a particular problem faced by target users
  requirement: interacting with stakeholders and users to collect and document project requirements
  design: creating the architecture of a software system and its elements
  development: building the software using a programming language by the development team
  testing: evaluating the quality of software with the aim of finding and fixing defects
  deployment: preparing the software to run and operate in a specific environment
  maintainance: updating and supporting the software after it  has been delivered to the market.

project execution methodologies
===============================

waterfall: design => code => test => deploy
agile: design => code => test => code => test => code => test => deploy
devops: design => code => test => code => test => code => test => deploy => code => test => code => test => code => test => deploy => code => test => code => test => code => test => deploy


          architecture---packaging---infrastructure
waterfall: monolithic---physical server---in-house datacentre
agile: n-tier decoupled---VM---hosted
devops: micro-services-containers-cloud

devops: what devops is not?
===========================
most common misundrstanding

  devops is not a role, person or organization
  devops is not a seperate team
  devops is not a product or a tool
  devops is not about just writing scripts or implementing tools

what is devops?
===============
devosp is not a goal, but a never ending process of continual improvement.

devops is about automation
it is about implementing agility in information
it is about implementing best practices with help of tools
devops is a culture
devops is not a technology, tool or framework.
devops is a cultural movement, mindset, philosophy to coordinate produce better, more reliable products by automating infrastructure, workflow, and continuously measuring application performance for which they use a lot of tools.

dev
===
application performance
  decrease latency by using apm tools
end user analytics
  monitor end user latency and check device performance
quality code
  ensure deployment don't degrade performance
code-level errors
  low mttr by finding error root cause
ops
===
application availability
  make sure uptime and SLAs are in order
application performance
  solve problems by correlating infrastructure and application metrics
end user complaints
  fix problems before end users complain
performance analysis
  use automatically generated baselines to focus troubleshooting

devops benefits
===============
  reliabiltiy
  reduced time to recover
  efficiency
  lower risk
  shorter dev cycle
  stability
  faster updates
  better user experience
  fewer failures
  higher quality
  faster product delivery
  cost savings

level
  beginner
    basics linux for debugging triaging 
    basic scripting knowledge
    release management
  practitioner
    continuous developemt
    continuous integration
    continuous delivery
    continuous testing
  proficient
    continuous deployment
    configuration management
    infrastructure as a code
  champ
    deployment orchestration
    cloud management
    continuous monitoring
  good to have
    python scripting
    collaboration skills
  
aws
===
  flexible services
  built for scale
  automation
  secure
  large partmer ecosystem

cloud computing
===============
delivery of on-demand computing services over the internet on pay asyou go basics.
  storing data/application on remote servers.
  processing data/application from servers.
  accessing data/application via internet.

features of cloud computing
===========================
  1. great availability of resources
  2. on-demand self-services
  3. easy maintenance
  4. large network access
  5. availability
  6. automtic system
  7. economical
  8. security
  9. pay-as-you-go

the deployment models of the cloud
==================================
private cloud:
  cloud services used by a single organization, not exposed to the public
  complete control
  security for sensitive application
  meet specific business needs

public cloud:
  cloud resources owned and operated by a third-party cloud service provider delivered over the internet

hybrid server:
  keep some servers on premises and extend some capabilites to the cloud
  control over sensitive assets in your private infrastructure
  flexibility and cost-effectiveness of the public cloud

what is aws?
============
amazon web services(aws) is a secure cloud services platform, offering compute power, database storage, content delivery and other functionality to help businesses scale and grow
